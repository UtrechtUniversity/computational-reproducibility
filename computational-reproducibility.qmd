<u>**WHAT IS REPRODUCIBILITY?**</u> <br>

</center>

. . .

_Computational reproducibility_ is when detailed information is provided about code, software, hardware and implementation details ([Victoria Stodden, 2014](http://edge.org/response-detail/25340)).

<u>**REPRODUCIBILITY VS. REPLICABILITY**</u> <br>

</center>

<br>

. . .

[Peng (2009)](https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/article/10/3/405/293660) provides a useful distinction:

::: {.incremental}

- **Reproduction** is when data sets and computer code are made available, and other researchers can verify results.
 
- **Replication** is when independent investigators use methods, protocols, data, and equipment to confirm scientific claims.

<u>**REPRODUCIBILITY SPECTRUM**</u> <br>

</center>

<br>

![](images/reproducibility-spectrum.png){fig-align="center"}

A study may be more or less reproducible than another depending on what data and code are made available ([Peng, 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3383002/)).

<center>

<u>**WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?**</u> <br>

</center>

. . .

1. To show evidence of the correctness of your results.
 
2. To enable others to make use of our methods and results.

. . .

**The stakeholders involved:**

- Collaborators
- Peer reviewers & journal editors
- Broad scientific community
- The public

. . .

<u>**BEING REPRODUCIBLE**</u> <br>

</center>

![](images/bad-example.png){fig-align="center"}

---

<center>

<u>**IS THIS ENOUGH?**</u> <br>

</center>

- Access to the code
- Access to the data
- (And let's assume we can replicate the environment)

. . .

How confident do you feel?

![](images/bad-example-extract.png){fig-align="center"}

. . .

We need to do more: we need to inspire trust.

---

<center>

<u>**INSPIRING TRUST CAN MEAN...**</u> <br>

</center>

. . .

- The code is correct (and I have made it easy for you/someone to check);
- My workflow is robust;
- My workflow itself is accessible, and I will be guiding you through it.

<u>**THE FOUR FACETS OF REPRODUCIBILITY**</u> <br>

<br>

1. Organization
2. Documentation
3. Automation
4. Dissemination

<u>**ORGANIZATION**</u> <br>

. . .

**Why do you need it?**

. . .
 
1. Your future self will be able to quickly find files.
 
2. Colleagues will be able to more quickly understand your workflow.
 
3. Machine-readable names can be quickly and easily sorted and parsed.
